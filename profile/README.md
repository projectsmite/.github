With the rising number of cases where Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are used for malicious purposes, 
more people need to understand how these devices are being leveraged for wrongdoing.
Furthermore, despite the global Radio Frequency Identification market growing at unprecedented rates,
research has shown that vulnerable access control systems are still widely used across the world.
These access control systems can be exploited by IoT devices.

Therefore, the SMITE Device was created to help gain understanding on how IoT devices are used by malicious actors, 
and to be a multi-purpose tool capable of penetration testing, securing these vulnerable systems. 
The SMITE Device was created with 3 main functionalities in mind â€“ Radio Frequency Identification hacking, 
Infrared Hijacking and Stealth Camera Utilities.
